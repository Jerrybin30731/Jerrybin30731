            "STUDENT: I think it's more of the-- and less of the code, the syntax itself.\n",
            "Because that, you can kind of pick up quite quickly.\n",
            "I think the hardest thing is probably to how you construct efficient code.\n",

            "It's like, I don't even know what's out there.\n",

            "already.\n",
            "CARTER ZENKE: Yeah, exactly.\n",
            "So there's this idea of how you take this idea you have\n",
            "and what you want to build and turn into the syntax,\n",
            "like actually write to make the computer do what you want it to do, right?\n",
            "So all these are good questions.\n",
            "And here are a few we'll actually dive in to today.\n",
            "The first is, why are we using C?\n",
            "Why we're using this ancient language to start off programming with?\n",
            "And how do we learn and read its syntax here?\n",
            "How can we actually learn how to create and read these variables, these loops\n",
            "and conditionals, and so on.\n",
            "As we go through that, we'll talk about this particular instance of a data type\n",
            "because C requires us to tell what type each pieces of our data are.\n",
            "We'll also talk about compiling C programs, taking them from source code\n",
            "to machine code.\n",
            "And then finally, at the very end, we'll talk\n",
            "about how many years it will take to double our number of llamas\n",
            "that we have in the lab.\n",
            "So to kick things off here, we can go back to actually lecture zero,\n",
            "I think, back to our contact application.\n",
            "So in this application we stored names and phone numbers and other things too.\n",
            "What else could we store in a contact's application?\n",
            "Could I ask maybe somebody from the second row, in this middle row here?\n",
            "What can we store in a contact's application?\n",
            "Yeah, go ahead.\n",
            "STUDENT: Phone numbers.\n",
            "CARTER ZENKE: Phone numbers, right, other things too.\n",
            "Maybe somebody in the row up now.\n",
            "STUDENT: Emails.\n",
            "CARTER ZENKE: Emails, OK.\n",
            "Other things?\n",
            "Let's go one row up again.\n",
            "What else can we store?\n",
            "STUDENT: Addresses.\n",
            "CARTER ZENKE: Addresses, nice.\n",
            "So all these things we can store in our contact's application.\n",
            "But let's say you want to store the number of times\n",
            "I want to actually have made a call before in my application, on my phone,\n",
            "right?\n",
            "So here we have an instance of a variable, some number or some value\n",
            "that can change.\n",
            "And I'm going to give a name to it, in this case, calls,\n",
            "number of times I called somebody here.\n",
            "So this is our mental representation of what a variable is.\n",
            "It's some name for a value that can change.\n",
            "But in C, we have a particular syntax I'll use to make variables.\n",
            "As you all go through and work on the course's problem set,\n",
            "build your own programs, you really should get familiar with this syntax\n",
            "and how to read and write it here.\n",
            "So here we have the syntax in C to create this variable named calls.\n",
            "And there are some components to it that we should actually dive into here.\n",
            "So the first part is the variable's name.\n",
            "This name is calls.\n",
            "Notice how it's in the middle of this sentence here.\n",
            "We also have the variables type, this int type.\n",
            "And what does this int type stand for?\n",
            "What kind of number are we going to store in here?\n",
            "Could I ask somebody from down here?\n",
            "Yeah, go ahead.\n",
            "STUDENT: An integer.\n",
            "CARTER ZENKE: An integer, so a whole number, right?\n",
            "Then we have the value, in this case, 4, that value we're\n",
            "putting inside this variable here.\n",
            "But there's one piece we're missing, we haven't talked about yet.\n",
            "What haven't we named here yet?\n",
            "Could I ask somebody from maybe this side of the room?\n",
            "Take a guess?\n",
            "We talked about the name of the variable, the type, the value.\n",
            "What syntax haven't we shown yet?\n",
            "Yeah, go ahead.\n",
            "STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE] semicolon [INAUDIBLE]..\n",
            "CARTER ZENKE: The semicolon, right?\n",
            "So this is a statement in C. And every closing statement that we have,\n",
            "we want to include a semicolon there.\n",

            "Yeah, go ahead.\n",
            "STUDENT: Basically, we said that C wants to know data type.\n",
            "That's in order restrict the values that we input.\n",
            "For instance, if we're talking about [INAUDIBLE] input\n",
            "3.5, so for [INAUDIBLE].\n",
            "So it limits [INAUDIBLE].\n",

            "Other reasons too.\n",
            "Could we go to maybe down here?\n",
            "Yeah.\n",
            "STUDENT: The computer needs to know how much memory\n",
            "to allocate to the [INAUDIBLE].\n",
            "CARTER ZENKE: Yeah, and why would that matter?\n",
            "Can I ask you, get a little deeper too?\n",
            "Why does this size matter?\n",
            "STUDENT: Because I think an integer is a lot less size than--\n",
            "a lot less [INAUDIBLE].\n",
            "CARTER ZENKE: Totally, so using--\n",
            "or storing different values makes that value take away\n",
            "different space in a computer's memory.\n",
            "So integers take up maybe 32 bits, but a character\n",
            "might take up only eight bits.\n",
            "And so it tells the compiler how much memory,\n",
            "how much space to reserve here too.\n",
            "One other reason that we saw a little bit in lecture as well is we\n",
            "have some binary here, these eight bits that can represent a certain, well,\n",
            "really anything.\n",
            "What does this represent here?\n",
            "Anyone know off the top of their head?\n",
            "Yeah.\n",
            "STUDENT: No, sorry.\n",
            "CARTER ZENKE: Oh, no, OK.\n",
            "I'd be surprised if you do.\n",
            "But one thing this represents is the number or the integer 65, right?\n",
            "But as we saw in lecture a little bit too\n",

            "Those same binary bits can represent\n",
            "both 65 and this character A.\n",
            "So it's important we\n",
            "tell C which thing we're talking about here by giving us our data types.\n",
            "So that's the reason we have these data types here.\n",
            "If we want to go further into variables, we can update them if we'd like.\n",
            "And here we have on this very first line the declaration and initialization\n",
            "of this variable calls.\n",
            "And down below we just update that value.\n",
            "So notice the type is on that top line, but it's not on that next line.\n",
            "And why would that be, if I can ask somebody from this side of the room\n",
            "now?\n",
            "Why is it on that top line but not that second line?\n",
            "Yeah, go ahead.\n",
            "STUDENT: On the first line you're initiating the variable\n",
            "and telling the computer what the data type is.\n",
            "On the second line, you're reassigning it to the new value,\n",
            "and it already knows that that variable [INAUDIBLE]..\n",
            "CARTER ZENKE: Yeah, so the computer is pretty good at remembering things,\n",
            "right?\n",
            "And once you've told it that this variable has a certain type, no need\n",
            "to tell it again.\n",
            "It already knows that.\n",
            "We can just keep going as we go.\n",
            "So here we're going to initialize and declare the variable calls.\n",
            "But when we use it again, we don't have to tell it the type as we go through.\n",
            "Now, if we wanted to change that value, we could do it like this.\n",
            "We also have some operators at our disposal.\n",
            "We could add 1 to it using this plus sign.\n",
            "We could even subtract some numbers.\n",
            "We could maybe multiply some numbers using that star operator.\n",
            "We could even divide some numbers, and so on.\n",
            "So feel free to take a look at those.\n",
            "If you go through the course, I'm sure these come top of your head\n",
            "as we go through.\n",
            "But when it comes to assigning some variable, what looks like a function,\n",
            "right, that's where things get a little bit weird.\n",
            "We saw in lecture we're trying to get some input from a user, right?\n",
            "And we didn't say that maybe string name equals quote \"Carter.\"\n",
            "We said it equals this, maybe, function, get string.\n",
            "Or here, if we wanted to store a value in calls, get int.\n",
            "And in this case, before we're reading left to right.\n",
            "But in this case, it's actually better to read right to left\n",
            "when you see this function call on the right-hand side.\n",
            "So what's happening here is, when you have\n",
            "this function on the right-hand side, this function\n",
            "is wanting to run and then give us back some return\n",
            "value that will be stored inside this variable on the left-hand side.\n",
            "So before anything else, we run this function on the right-hand side\n",
            "with some certain arguments, some input to that function\n",
            "tell it what exactly to do.\n",
            "That function runs.\n",
            "Maybe it asks the user for this integer number here.\n",
            "And we then store that value right where that function was called.\n",
            "And it then goes into that variable.\n",
            "And now we're back to simple variable assignment here.\n",
            "So usually, if you're simply assigning numbers, you can read left to right.\n",
            "But if you have these function calls, best to read right to left,\n",
            "and knowing that your function runs first and then assigns that value\n",
            "as we go through.\n",
            "So questions on this before we dive even deeper.\n",
            "Seeing none.\n",
            "So now that we have these values stored in these variables,\n",
            "it's probably worthwhile to think about how we print them to the screen.\n",
            "And here's what we saw a little bit in lecture as well,\n",
            "this % and then this i here.\n",
            "And what is this doing for us?\n",
            "Could I ask somebody from this middle section here.\n",
            "Let's go to the first row, if you don't mind.\n",
            "Yeah.\n",
            "STUDENT: It's a placeholder for our variable call.\n",
            "CARTER ZENKE: Yeah, placeholder for your calls.\n",
            "And why is it %i?\n",
            "Do you know?\n",
            "STUDENT: Because it's an integer [INAUDIBLE]..\n",
            "CARTER ZENKE: Yeah.\n",
            "STUDENT: i represents [INAUDIBLE].\n",
            "CARTER ZENKE: Right, so %i.\n",
            "This % is kind of saying like, hey, this is a placeholder.\n",
            "And that i specifies what kind of variable\n",
            "can go inside of that placeholder there.\n",
            "So because call is an integer, it's %i.\n",
            "And that's called, more specifically a format code, as we might have said.\n",
            "And we have this value that we can store in that format code there.\n",
            "We could have multiple format codes and multiple values.\n",
            "We just separate them by commas.\n",
            "So you can imagine, for example, I have %i here and maybe %i later on.\n",
            "I could have calls and then comma, some other variable.\n",
            "And those would go inside those placeholders one\n",
            "by one, aligning with whatever order I put them in as we go through.\n",
            "Now, it's not worth memorizing any of these,\n",
            "but there are a great number of format codes for different data types.\n",
            "And as you work with a variety of data types,\n",
            "best you can maybe reference these once in a while.\n",
            "So here on the left-hand side, we have number\n",
            "format codes, like ints and longs, floats and doubles,\n",
            "and the right-hand side some chars and strings,\n",
            "where chars are individual characters.\n",
            "And strings are collections of characters as we go through.\n",
            "One thing we haven't quite seen as much yet is this long and double.\n",
            "Anyone want to hazard a guess as to what that might be here?\n",
            "Could I ask somebody from this middle row again?\n",
            "What is this long and double doing for us?\n",
            "Yeah, go ahead.\n",
            "STUDENT: Does the long [INAUDIBLE] more room [INAUDIBLE]\n",
            "you have to have the long to [INAUDIBLE]??\n",
            "CARTER ZENKE: Yeah, exactly.\n",
            "So here we had an integer that could store up to four billion values.\n",
            "But when that's not enough, we might want\n",
            "to have a longer value, in this case, called a long,\n",
            "that will have twice as much space for us.\n",
            "We can store twice as many different combinations as we go through.\n",
            "Really, more than that.\n",
            "We're just having twice as many bits to represent that information.\n",
            "And similarly, for the float, that's a decimal number.\n",
            "But this double is called a double precision floating point.\n",
            "So we'd have twice as many decimals, twice many binary digits\n",
            "representing that decimal number there for us\n",
            "as well, so just more space for us to use as we go through.\n",
            "Now, what we'll do here is a brief exercise\n",
            "and invite you to load up code.cs50.io on your own laptop here.\n",
            "And you should see something that looks a bit like this.\n",
            "Maybe you have a File Explorer on the left-hand side.\n",
            "But you should certainly have a terminal down below.\n",
            "I see a question.\n",
            "Yeah.\n",
            "STUDENT: I'm not sure if this was a typo to be like this.\n",
            "But if you go back to the slide--\n",
            "CARTER ZENKE: Yeah, yeah.\n",
            "STUDENT: So the double says f, and the float says f.\n",
            "Is that correct?\n",
            "CARTER ZENKE: That is correct.\n",
            "So both the float and the double have the same format code, yeah.\n",
            "Good question.\n",
            "STUDENT: So how does the computer [INAUDIBLE]\n",
            "recognize between [INAUDIBLE]?\n",
            "CARTER ZENKE: How does the computer recognize each one?\n",
            "In this case, it doesn't quite matter because, in this case,\n",
            "the float and the double are both decimal numbers.\n",
            "And so the computer knows when it sees %f, I'm printing a decimal number.\n",
            "It just so happens to be that the double is twice as long.\n",
            "And so it just prints that many more--\n",
            "well, it can print that many more spaces after the decimal point\n",
            "if you'd like it to.\n",
            "Yeah, other questions here before we move on?\n",
            "All right, so we'll work on a brief exercise here.\n",
            "And once you've loaded up your IDE in code.cs50.io,\n",
            "you go ahead and create an application called phonebook.c.\n",
            "And the goal is to prompt the user for these three things\n",

            "CARTER ZENKE: Yeah, code and the file name.\n",
            "So I could do code, if it will load here.\n",

            "But on your own, you could certainly do code and in the file name here.\n",
            "And for our purposes, I'll do code space maybe phonebook.c.\n",

            "Now, once you have your file, what tends to go at the very top of that file?\n",
            "What's the first thing you might add?\n",

            "STUDENT: Get string.\n",
            "CARTER ZENKE: Get string.\n",
            "And how did you make your variable in this case?\n",
            "STUDENT: So because our variable is a string, I put string.\n",
            "And then I titled my variable name.\n",
            "CARTER ZENKE: Nice.\n",
            "STUDENT: And then I said equals get string what's your name.\n",
            "CARTER ZENKE: Get string, what's your name.\n",
            "So something like this?\n",
            "STUDENT: With a space after the name.\n",
            "CARTER ZENKE: Yeah, and why would you have that space there?\n",
            "STUDENT: Just for readability.\n",
            "CARTER ZENKE: Just readability, right?\n",
            "If we don't have that space there, if we maybe remove this,\n",
            "the user will be typing in their name right up\n",
            "against that question mark there, which is not\n",
            "what we want to have happen here.\n",
            "So it seems pretty logical to represent a name with a string.\n",
            "But how about the age here?\n",
            "Can I go maybe to this side of the room?\n",
            "How did you all work on getting the users the contact's age?\n",
            "Yeah.\n",
            "STUDENT: I did int age equals get int, and then in brackets I had--\n",
            "CARTER ZENKE: What's your age with a space, right?\n",
            "And then the semicolon.\n",
            "Perfect.\n",
            "So that'll close that statement.\n",
            "And again, this function on the right will be called.\n",
            "It will run and then give us back some return value, which is\n",
            "whatever the user typed in, and store it inside of this variable named age.\n",
            "And then comes one with some--\n",
            "question here?\n",
            "STUDENT: Can we also write string age [INAUDIBLE]??\n",
            "CARTER ZENKE: Yeah, so did you try that one here?\n",
            "STUDENT: Yeah, what's the [INAUDIBLE]?\n",
            "CARTER ZENKE: Good question.\n",
            "So we could do either of these here.\n",
            "One is an integer.\n",
            "One is a string.\n",
            "But you could imagine, if I later wanted to do something like this,\n",
            "let's say I wanted to actually increase every person's age in my phone by one,\n",
            "maybe it's their birthday next year.\n",
            "So I say age equals age plus 1.\n",
            "Is that going to work with a string, do you think?\n",
            "STUDENT: No.\n",
            "CARTER ZENKE: No, because I'm going to add 1 to this quote unquote maybe 40,\n",
            "for example.\n",
            "And I can't add numbers to strings.\n",
            "That's not going to happen for me.\n",
            "So it's best when you're making these to just think\n",
            "about what you want to do with them as you work in your program here.\n",
            "So I want to maybe change my age as I go through.\n",
            "So I'll actually maybe make this an integer here and say get int instead.\n",
            "And now for the phone number.\n",
            "If you go to this middle section here, how did you all\n",
            "choose to represent the phone number?\n",
            "Yeah.\n",

            "CARTER ZENKE: Long number is equal to get long.\n",
            "And you'd ask maybe what's your phone number.\n",
            "STUDENT: Yeah.\n",
            "CARTER ZENKE: And I think I'm most curious here\n",
            "about why you chose a long.\n",
            "Why would you have that?\n",
            "Yeah.\n",
            "STUDENT: Because it's more than 2 billion,\n",
            "so you need the extra [INAUDIBLE].\n",
            "CARTER ZENKE: Yeah, so a phone number is what?\n",
            "Maybe 10 digits long.\n",
            "And so if I had any phone number that begins with anything higher than two,\n",
            "that's going to be higher than two billion,\n",
            "which is the highest positive number I can have as an integer.\n",
            "So I want to actually have a long here.\n",
            "Yeah, question.\n",
            "STUDENT: Could you use a string to--\n",
            "CARTER ZENKE: You absolutely could use a string.\n",
            "And why would maybe you advocate for using a string?\n",
            "STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]\n",
            "CARTER ZENKE: Nice, so hyphens.\n",
            "You could also include, if you're maybe in different countries,\n",
            "plus 1 for this country code plus other country codes as well.\n",
            "You could even have parentheses if you'd like to put the area code in front.\n",
            "Yeah.\n",
            "STUDENT: Also, I think that if you use an integer or a long,\n",
            "you are supposed to be able to calculate stuff based on that number.\n",
            "And usually, you don't add stuff or divide the phone number.\n",
            "So there is no actual purpose to ask for a [INAUDIBLE]..\n",
            "CARTER ZENKE: Yeah, definitely.\n",
            "So we tend not to add things to phone numbers.\n",
            "So why store it as number we could add things to or subtract things\n",
            "to or divide or whatever we'd like, right?\n",
            "Good question there.\n",
            "So we have it as a string here.\n",
            "The string also preserves things like leading zeros.\n",
            "Maybe there's an odd chance that somebody has a 000 number,\n",
            "and we could store that with a string but not, for example, a long.\n",
            "We tend to remove those leading zeros in that case.\n",
            "Yeah.\n",
            "STUDENT: But [INAUDIBLE] to use the long [INAUDIBLE] one\n",
            "that doesn't really require that?\n",
            "CARTER ZENKE: If I were to say maybe long age here?\n",
            "STUDENT: Yeah.\n",
            "CARTER ZENKE: And maybe get long to have parity.\n",
            "Nothing bad would happen here.\n",
            "I'm probably just using twice as much space as I would need to.\n",
            "So generally, I don't think people have an age above two billion.\n",
            "And so I would probably want to just use a regular integer to store that value.\n",
            "Nice.\n",
            "Other questions on these representations of this information here?\n",
            "OK, so we'll go with this integer.\n",
            "And then just real quickly to review our format code,\n",
            "so let's say I wanted to print out some of this data.\n",
            "I could say printf.\n",
            "And let's say, maybe age is--\n",
            "what would I then say?\n",
            "Maybe just call it out.\n",
            "STUDENT: %i.\n",
            "CARTER ZENKE: %i, OK.\n",
            "Age is %i.\n",
            "I'm going to put period here.\n",
            "Name is %s.\n",
            "And let's go ahead and say phone number is %s, all right?\n",
            "And now to store this, as we saw earlier,\n",
            "I could simply just put these variables in the same order\n",
            "I want them to show up in those placeholders here.\n",
            "So I could say, OK, age is first.\n",
            "So I'll say age, then name.\n",
            "So I'll say name.\n",
            "And then finally number, so I'll say number and close everything out\n",
            "with the semicolon here.\n",
            "And I were to make this, I just type make phone book and run it.\n",
            "I would then see this information printed back out to me on the screen\n",
            "as such.\n",
            "So questions on this before we move on.\n",
            "All right, so one of the other building blocks\n",
            "that we have besides these variables and representations\n",
            "here are these conditionals and these loops.\n",
            "And we saw these in lecture as well, but we'll\n",
            "use these now for the course's lab to work on together.\n",
            "So first thing here, we have this question.\n",
            "Have I called less than one time?\n",
            "And if I have, then I'll say call more often.\n",
            "But just to get some vocabulary down here,\n",
            "this on the inside of that conditional is our Boolean expression.\n",
            "It's either yes or no.\n",
            "Have I called less than one time or not?\n",
            "On the outside here is that conditional itself.\n",
            "So conditionals have these Boolean expressions on the inside of them.\n",
            "I could make this a little more advanced though,\n",
            "and I could have this else in the middle.\n",
            "And what would that do for me?\n",
            "Could I ever execute these two things at the same time?\n",
            "Could I ask over here?\n",
            "Could I ever do these two things at the same time?\n",
            "Shaking your head no.\n",
            "Right.\n",
            "So these two things are mutually exclusive.\n",
            "If I have this else here, I'm saying it's either one or the other.\n",
            "If calls is less than 1, I will do that first thing.\n",
            "If it's not, I will do that second thing.\n",
            "You can chain these statements together if you saw-- even in Scratch.\n",
            "You could say if and then else if and then else if,\n",
            "and finally, it's long else.\n",
            "In general, we have these if statements followed by these else\n",
            "if statements, followed by if you need them, that final else to say,\n",
            "like a catch all for everything else that we could happen have happen here.\n",
            "For loops though, if you wanted to do something multiple times,\n",
            "we have something that looks a bit like this, this while loop.\n",
            "And what would this print to the screen?\n",
            "Could I ask somebody from maybe this side of the room?\n",
            "What would you see on the screen with this loop here?\n",
            "Yeah, go ahead.\n",
            "STUDENT: 0, 1, 2, 3 up to 9.\n",
            "CARTER ZENKE: Up to 9, and why not the 10?\n",
            "STUDENT: Because it's while i is less than 10.\n",
            "CARTER ZENKE: Nice.\n",
            "Yeah, so we wouldn't see the 10 because we're going to stop while--\n",
            "we're going to stop if this is not true.\n",
            "And so 10 is not less than 10, so we would stop\n",
            "and we wouldn't do the code on the inside, right?\n",
            "So to break things down even further, we have our initialization of this loop.\n",
            "I is first set to 0.\n",
            "Then we have our Boolean expression, this\n",
            "question we're going to ask, either yes or no.\n",
            "Is this case true or is it not?\n",
            "And then finally, this implementation, changing that value as we go through.\n",
            "And finally, when our Boolean expression is no longer true,\n",
            "we will not be inside of that loop there.\n",
            "This is really handy.\n",
            "We can actually try to make our code run a certain number of times.\n",
            "And this is so handy that C actually has our own syntax\n",
            "to write this kind of loop in even abbreviated format.\n",
            "So here we call a for loop that has all those same elements but now just\n",
            "on one clean line.\n",
            "We have this initialization, this Boolean expression,\n",
            "and then this incrementation here.\n",
            "And we'll do whatever a piece of code is on the inside\n",
            "as long as this Boolean expression is true.\n",
            "So questions on this kind of syntax for these loops?\n",
            "Pretty good.\n",
            "And finally, I just wanted to get a little more advanced.\n",
            "We have this-- yeah, go ahead.\n",
            "STUDENT: I have a question [INAUDIBLE].\n",
            "Why int [INAUDIBLE] parentheses [INAUDIBLE]??\n",
            "CARTER ZENKE: Good question.\n",
            "So you saw the int here?\n",
            "STUDENT: Yeah.\n",
            "CARTER ZENKE: And why is that there, right,\n",
            "because previously, we had the int i already done for us, right?\n",
            "So these are actually two different contexts.\n",
            "So here, I have created this variable named i,\n",
            "and I'm going to use it inside of this loop.\n",
            "And this variable i, because it's outside of this while loop,\n",
            "will persist as we go through my program.\n",
            "So I could use this variable i again.\n",
            "In the for loop though, if I were to create this variable i anew,\n",
            "I can only use it inside this for loop.\n",
            "I could not use it outside of that for loop.\n",

            "Great.\n",
            "Other questions here too.\n",
            "STUDENT: I see no semicolon at the end of the for loop.\n",
            "CARTER ZENKE: Yeah, why is there no semicolon?\n",
            "Well, probably a rule of thumb is this.\n",
            "Semicolons come after complete statements.\n",
            "And this for loop is kind of setting up some set of statements.\n",
            "It's saying, I'm going to eventually have something I want to do,\n",
            "but it's not there yet.\n",
            "So I'm going to actually have these braces\n",
            "to tell what statements I want to execute sequentially as I go through.\n",
            "So you'll get used to this as you go through and write more code.\n",

            "but things that set up statements generally don't.\n",
            "They might have these braces, yeah.\n",
            "Yeah.\n",
            "STUDENT: So you mentioned [INAUDIBLE] variable\n",
            "i only exists within the parameter.\n",
            "CARTER ZENKE: Exactly.\n",
            "STUDENT: Does that mean when you do multiple for loops in a row\n",
            "not with [INAUDIBLE]?\n",
            "CARTER ZENKE: Yeah, it's a good question.\n",
            "So let's say if I go back to my actual programming environment here,\n",
            "let's say I have a loop.\n",
            "And I'm going to say four int i equals 0. i is less than 10.\n",

            "It persists in this space here.\n",
            "I can't use i out here.\n",
            "So I can't access it there, but I could, for example, have another for loop\n",
            "on the inside.\n",
            "I could say for int j equals i.\n",
            "That's totally valid because i's inside this loop.\n",
            "Maybe j is less than 10 in this case, and then j++.\n",

            "I can't do that, but it is accessible inside that loop there.\n",
            "Other questions here too?\n",
            "Yeah.\n",
            "STUDENT: I'm a little confused.\n",
            "Where's the part that, I guess, senses what i is?\n",
            "It just appears [INAUDIBLE].\n",
            "CARTER ZENKE: Yeah, can you tell me what you mean by senses what i is?\n",
            "STUDENT: Right, so because it's like a Boolean expression,\n",
            "right, whether i is greater than 1 or less than 1, like that kind of thing.\n",
            "So where's the input of whether it's going to be 1 or i what value it is?\n",
            "CARTER ZENKE: Yeah, so probably best to think of it like this,\n",
            "where my code is read top to bottom.\n",
            "And when it gets to this for loop, it's read kind of left to right.\n",
            "So the first time I get to this for loop, I'm going to make this variable i\n",
            "and set it to 0.\n",
            "Then I'm going to ask the question, is i less than 10?\n",
            "OK, it is, so I'll actually go inside this for loop\n",
            "and maybe run this code on the inside.\n",
            "Once I get to the bottom of this for loop here, I'll then go to the top.\n",
            "And I'll do this.\n",
            "I'll increase i by 1.\n",
            "And I'll ask the question again.\n",
            "Is i less than 10?\n",
            "It is.\n",
            "OK, I'll do this code again.\n",
            "Once it finishes, I'll increase i by 1 again, ask the question, keep going,\n",
            "and keep going.\n",
            "Does that help?\n",
            "STUDENT: OK, got it.\n",
            "So the input was i equals 0 first, and then [INAUDIBLE]..\n",
            "CARTER ZENKE: Exactly, this is our initialization.\n",
            "This is the first time for loop runs, set it to this value.\n",
