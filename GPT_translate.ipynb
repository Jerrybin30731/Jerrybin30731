            "The syntax might look a little more cumbersome,\n",

            "or 4,000 bytes for 1,000 floats, because each float takes up\n",
            "four bytes of space.\n",

            "Just as I would on stack_array, I can access its elements individually\n",
            "using heap_array zero, heap_array one.\n",
            "But recall the reason we can do that is because the name of an array in C\n",

            "And sometimes these memory leaks can actually be really devastating\n",

            "but then not told the system that it's done with it.\n",

            "同時建立了一個指向一塊記憶體的指標，然後對它進行了一些操作。\n",
            "然而，動態分配內存的一個大問題是，這就是為什麼在使用它時開發良好習慣非常重要的原因。\n",
            "與靜態聲明的內存不同，您的內存在函數完成後不會自動返回到系統。\n",
            "因此，如果我們有一個 main 函式，並且 main 調用一個名為 f 的函式，當 f 完成其任務並將程序的控制權返回給 main 後，f 使用的所有記憶體都會被歸還。\n",
            "它可以再次被其他程式使用，或者在主程式中稍後呼叫的其他函數中使用。\n",
            "它可以反复使用同一個記憶體。\n",
            "如果您動態分配了內存，您必須明確地告訴系統您已經完成了它。\n",
            "它會為您保留它，這可能會導致您內存耗盡的問題。\n",
            "事實上，有時我們稱這種情況為記憶體洩漏。\n",
            "有時這些內存洩漏可能會對系統性能造成嚴重的影響。\n",
            "如果您是一個經常使用網路的使用者，您可能會使用某些網頁瀏覽器，而我不會在這裡透露名字，但是有些網頁瀏覽器因為存在無法修復的記憶體洩漏問題而聲名狼藉。\n",
            "如果你讓瀏覽器開啟很長一段時間，幾天甚至是數週，有時你會發現你的系統運行非常緩慢。\n",
            "這是因為瀏覽器已經分配了記憶體，但在使用完畢後並未告知系統可以釋放它。\n",
            "這導致你的其他程式可用的記憶體較少，因為你的瀏覽器程式在不斷洩漏記憶體。\n",
            "當我們完成使用記憶體時，該怎麼歸還它呢？\n",
            "很幸運的是，這是一個非常簡單的方法。\n",
            "我們只是釋放它。\n",
            "有一個名為free的函數，它接受一個指向記憶體的指針，然後我們就可以開始使用了。\n",
            "假設我們的程式執行到了一半，需要動態配置 50 個字元的空間，我們可以使用 malloc。\n",
            "我們希望malloc一個能夠容納50個字符的數組。\n",
            "當我們取回一個指向它的指針時，這個指針的名字就叫做「word」。\n",
            "我們使用 Word 進行操作，\n",
            "完成後就將其釋放。\n",
            "現在，我們已經將那 50 個位元組的記憶體還回給系統。\n",
            "其他功能可以使用它們。\n",
            "我們不必擔心發生記憶體洩漏，因為我們已釋放了 \"word\"。\n",
            "我們已經歸還了記憶體，所以我們已經完成與它的工作。\n",
            "因此，當你使用malloc動態分配內存時，應該牢記三個黃金法則。\n",
            "每當你使用 malloc 分配一塊內存時，都必須在程式結束前釋放它。\n",
            "現在，無論是在設備或是在集成開發環境中，當您的程式終止時，所有的內存都將自動被釋放，因此這種情況也會自動發生。\n",
            "但是，通常還是好的編程習慣，當你完成後，總是要釋放你 mallocd 的內存。\n",
            "儘管如此，只有你已經進行了malloc操作的資源，才應該被釋放。\n",
            "如果你靜態聲明一個整數 int x 分號，它存在堆疊上，你就不想釋放 x。\n",
            "所以只有你使用了 malloc 分配内存的对象才需要被 free 释放。\n",
            "最後，請勿重複釋放同一個內存空間。\n",
            "這可能導致另一個奇怪的狀況。\n",
            "所以你使用了 malloc 的所有物件都必須被釋放。\n",
            "只有你使用了 malloc 的物件需要被釋放。\n",
            "不要重複釋放同一個內存。\n",
            "讓我們通過一個例子來了解一些動態分配的記憶體是如何與一些靜態記憶體混合使用的。\n",
            "這裡可能會發生什麼事情？\n",
            "請試著跟隨並猜測在我們遍歷所有這些代碼行時會發生什麼。\n",
            "我們在這裡聲明了一個整數變量m。這樣做的效果是創建了一個新的變量，並為其分配了一塊新的記憶體，該記憶體被標記為\"m\"，並且只能保存整數類型的數值。以後我們可以使用變量名\"m\"來操作這個記憶體空間。\n",
            "好的，這很直截了當。\n",
            "我創建了一個叫做m的整數變量。\n",
            "我將它標記為綠色，因為當我談論整數變量時，這是我使用的顏色。\n",
            "這是一個盒子。\n",
            "這個被稱為m，你可以在其中儲存整數。\n",
            "如果我接著說 int star a，會怎麼樣？\n",
            "那真的很相似。\n",
            "我正在創建一個名為a的方形盒子。\n",
            "它可以存儲int類型的值和指向整數的指針。\n",
            "所以我也把它染成綠色的調子。\n",
            "我知道這與整數有關，但它本身不是一個整數。\n",
            "但基本上是相同的想法。\n",
            "我創建了一個方塊。\n",
            "這兩個現在都存在於堆疊中。\n",
            "我已經給了它們兩個名字。\n",
            "int *star_b 等於 malloc(sizeof(int))。\n",
            "沒問題，我會盡力完成這個翻譯任務。請提供需要翻譯的技術文件。\n",
            "請花一點時間想想您期望在此圖中發生的事情。\n",
            "int *b = malloc(sizeof(int));\n",
            "這不只是創建一個方框。\n",
            "這實際上創建了兩個方框。\n",
            "這也意味著它建立了一個關係中的一個重要點。\n",
            "我們已在堆上分配了一個記憶體區塊。\n",
            "請注意右上方的方框並沒有名稱。\n",
            "我們使用了 malloc 進行內存動態分配。\n",
            "它存在於堆疊中。\n",
            "但 b 有一個名字。\n",
            "這是一個名為 b 的指標變數。\n",
            "這存在於堆疊(Stack)上。\n",
            "所以這是一塊指向另一塊記憶體的記憶體區塊。\n",
            "b 包含了該塊記憶體的位址。\n",
            "否則它就沒有名字。\n",
            "但它指向它。\n",
            "因此，當我們說int star b等於malloc size of int時，右側有一個箭頭彈出來，整個過程如下所示，我會再次讓它出現。\n",
            "所有的這一切都在那一行程式碼中發生。\n",
            "現在我們再回歸到更簡單明瞭的部分。\n",
            "a 等於 &m。\n",
            "您還記得 a 等於 &m 是什麼嗎？\n",
            "這是一個獲取 m 的地址。\n",

            "好的，這裡還有另一個。\n",
            "A 等於 b。\n",
            "這次圖表會發生什麼事情？\n",
            "請注意，賦值運算符的作用是將右邊的值賦予給左邊的值。\n",
            "因此，現在 a 指向與 b 指向的相同位置，而不是指向 m。\n",
            "a 不是指向 b，a 指向 b 指向的位置。\n",
            "如果 a 指向 b，那這相當於 a 等於 &b。\n",
            "但是，a等於b只是意味著a和b現在指向相同的地址，因為b內部只是一個地址。\n",
            "現在，在a裡面的地址是相同的。\n",
            "m 等於 10，可能是我們最簡單的事情之一。\n",
            "把10放進箱子裡。\n",
            "星號 b 等於 m 加 2，請回想一下我們指標影片中星號 b 的定義。\n",
            "我們將對 b 進行解參考（dereference），並在該記憶體位置放入某個值。\n",
            "在這種情況下，12。\n",
            "當我們解引用一個回憶點時，我們只需要沿著箭頭向下走。\n",
            "或者換句話說，我們前往該記憶體地址，並以某種方式對其進行操作。\n",
            "我們在那裡放置了一些值。\n",
            "在這種情況下，star b等於m加2只是去變量b所指向的位置，進入b所指向的內存，並將m加2放置在其中，即12。\n",
            ">> 現在我是自由的 b。\n",
            "當我釋放 b 時會發生什麼事情？\n",

            "現在如果我說變數star a等於11，你可能已經可以想到這裡會出現一些問題，對吧？\n",
            "事實上，如果我嘗試這樣做，我可能會遭遇分段錯誤。\n",
            "因為現在，儘管我之前可以訪問那塊內存，但現在我正在訪問我無權訪問的內存。\n",
